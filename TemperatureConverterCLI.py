""" Temperature Conversion Program
 Written by Ryan Cannon
 4/25/2022 4:39 P.M.

 Update 5/1/2022 2:42 A.M. 1. Added input() functions after the print statements in the main function so that the
 program doesn't automatically close when the program is executed outside an IDE.

 2. Made some adjustments to the options in the main function for user convenience

 3. Update 9/11/2022 12:02 A.M.(Or 0:02): Did some code restructuring as well as added comments to my code(Which I should have done in the first place) for maintenance and future analyzing purposes

 4. Update 10/9/2022 3:15 P.M. (or 15:15): Added some error checking as well as have the program convert
    any uppercase prompts to lower case for convenience. Also gave users the option of continuing or exiting
     the program
 5. Update 10/9/2022 8:42 P.M. (or 20:42): Modified the option section for the temperature and exitorcontinue
    to accept the full words such as yes or no, Celsius or Fahrenheit to be accepted in the prompts
    if the user wishes to type those instead
 6. Update 10/9/2022 10:45 P.M. (or 22:45): Added a try error exception to the prompts asking the user to enter the temperature
    so that the program wouldn't crash and exit if they entered a string value instead of a number
 7. Update 10/18/2022 11:29 P.M. (or 23:29) : It turns there is another temperature unit that I didn't know about before.
    After looking at the Google temperature converter, it turns out Kelvin is actually a thing. At first, I wasn't sure
    I was going to implement it into my temp conversion program since it would require rewriting quite a bit of my
    program and not many people use it. However, after one of my uncle's mentioned it after looking at my program
    and the fact that I could use this program as a template for other conversion programs such as a speed converter
    and a currency converter, I've decided to go ahead and implement Kelvin into my program.

 8. Update 1/22/2023 8:11 P.M. (or 20:11) : Fixed some errors in the program and added the features from the final home version
    into the pro edition."""
