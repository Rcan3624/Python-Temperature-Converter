       A temperature conversion program that I coded in Python as a fun personal project while learning to code.

       Able to convert Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin units
       Enter a number from 1 through 6 on the prompt screen to select the conversion option
       Once you are done with the program, type 'exit' or 'quit' into the prompt
       If you want to have some fun with the program, try typing in "What is the temperature of the Sun" or 'toasty'.

       Started in 4/25/2022 and coded in PyCharm 2022.2.2 Community Edition

       Now coded in Visual Studio Code 1.78.2
